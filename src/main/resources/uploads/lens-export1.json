A lanyard can have a breakaway mechanism that can detach the receptacle from a diver or other structure if sufficient force is applied to the lanyard. There can also be a shock-arrest mechanism that reduces the amount of force exerted on a diver or structure before the lanyard breaks. Force exerted on the lanyard pulls the floatable rim at least partially beneath the water surface causing the sections of the floatable rim come together and close over the mouth of the container to prevent loss of articles within the container.","Applicants":"DANIELS ERIC;;DANIELS GWENDOLYN L;;DANIELS IAN E","Inventors":"DANIELS ERIC;;DANIELS GWENDOLYN L;;DANIELS IAN E","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/052-423-263-251-41X","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"1","Cited by Patent Count":"1","Simple Family Size":"3","Extended Family Size":"3","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K97/20;;B65D85/50;;F16F7/006;;A62B35/04;;A01K77/00;;A01K97/20;;B63C11/26;;B65D25/00","IPCR Classifications":"B63C11/26;;B65D25/00","US Classifications":"220/560","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"ACTIVE"},{"#":"31","Jurisdiction":"KR","Kind":"A","Display Key":"KR 20150034910 A","Lens ID":"052-239-547-793-480","Publication Date":"2015-04-06","Publication Year":"2015","Application Number":"KR 20130114849 A","Application Date":"2013-09-27","Priority Numbers":"KR 20130114849 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2013-09-27","Title":"Fishing net pulling up apparatus","Abstract":"The present invention relates to a net pulling apparatus.

The minor hoop member is of a significantly smaller diameter than a diameter of the major hoop member and is securely retained in close, but spaced, orientation radially inward from the major hoop member. This provides for the operational passageway through the minor hoop member which objects may be netted to be nearly as large as that available utilizing just the major hoop member. This full function feature occurs while the major hoop member protects the inner hoop member, and the contact points therealong of the net material, from coming into contact with many obstructions during use of the net device to net objects. Easy removal and replacement of the minor hoop member permits replacement of existing net material.","Applicants":"LAMBERT LONNIE","Inventors":"LAMBERT

The net retainer includes a compressive retainer and a mounting means. The retainer is formed with a resilient arm that is configured to create a neck between the resilient arm and either the retainer or a mounting means through which a rim of the fishing net may be forced. Once the rim has been forced through the neck, the resilient arm returns to its initial position thereby securing the fishing net. The mounting means releasably attaches the retainer to the boat and may include retainer bands or screws to attach the retainer to a post on the boat, or a flat surface mounting implement to attach the retainer to any flat surface of the boat. An implement guard may be incorporated to improve the snag resistance of the retainer and minimize tripping hazards.","Applicants":"WILSON NICK","Inventors":"WILSON NICK","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/092-479-411-408-946","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"26","Cited by Patent Count":"4","Simple Family Size":"2","Extended Family Size":"2","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K75/00;;A01K75/00;;A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K75/00","US Classifications":"43/11;;114/255","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"INACTIVE"},{"#":"48","Jurisdiction":"CA","Kind":"A","Display Key":"CA 955745 A","Lens ID":"081-773-301-442-092","Publication Date":"1974-10-08","Publication Year":"1974","Application Number":"CA 124553 A","Application Date":"1971-10-06","Priority Numbers":"US 7946070 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1970-10-09","Title":"MULTIPLE PURPOSE GAME FISH LANDING EQUIPMENT","Abstract":"","Applicants":"FOSTER RAY W","Inventors":"FOSTER RAY W","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/081-773-301-442-092","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"0","Simple Family Size":"2","Extended Family Size":"2","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K97/14;;A01K97/14;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K97/14","US Classifications":"43-7","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"49","Jurisdiction":"US","Kind":"A1","Display Key":"US 2005/0198887 A1","Lens ID":"064-981-247-814-130","Publication Date":"2005-09-15","Publication Year":"2005","Application Number":"US 61646003 A","Application Date":"2003-07-08","Priority Numbers":"US 61646003 A;;US 1548701 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2001-12-11","Title":"Fish net with length measuring scale","Abstract":"A fish net, comprising a frame, and a net, attached to the frame, and including a length measuring scale disposed on the net, configured to allow a user to determine a size of a fish held in the net by visually comparing the fish with the length measuring scale.

When a fish is caught, the fist net, using only one hand is unfolded quickly when the fish is ready to be netted. During its quick one handed rotating to unfurl the netting and continued quick one handed sequential unfolding around two orthogonal axes, pivotal joints of the folding fish net at four locations are utilized. After the unfurling of the netting, during the first unfolding from the compacted non use position, a then longitudinally positioned divided handle, pivotally connected by a then horizontally arranged piano style hinge, and a central rim pivot joint on the folded rim, presently located closely opposite the handle, are both pivoted downwardly at the same time, through 180.degree. around a first then horizontally positioned rotational axis. Thereafter, two rim pivot joints on opposite sides of the foldable rim are pivoted about a horizontal rotational axis perpendicular to the first rotational axis, to enable the rim to be unfolded from its half size up and over through 180.degree. to full circle size, thereby supporting a full circular draping net which is passed under a fish. The divided handle, when fully open, via its piano style hinge, backs against itself to prevent further rotational movement. When a fisherman continues to grip the open handle, refolding of the net is prevented, without relying on any locking means. During this rapid one handed deployment of the folded fish net into a fully opened net, biasing springs are relied upon to snap the rim into its circular configuration. Also extruded stops prevent further rotational movement of the components of the rim once they reach the then horizontal circular configuration as they are unfolded to support the netting for receiving a fish. The fisherman, using his other hand to guide the fishing pole is still successfully managing the hooked fish as the fish is netted.","Applicants":"DAVIS BENNIE I","Inventors":"DAVIS BENNIE I","Owners":"DAVIS, EDNA E. 6149 BELMORE ROAD SW OLYMPIA, WASHI (1970-08-21)","URL":"https://lens.org/118-711-001-994-036","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"16","Cited by Patent Count":"18","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"43/12","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"70","Jurisdiction":"KR","Kind":"B1","Display Key":"KR 101275434 B1","Lens ID":"125-417-799-688-64X","Publication Date":"2013-06-17","Publication Year":"2013","Application Number":"KR 20120102978 A","Application Date":"2012-09-17","Priority Numbers":"KR 20120102978 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2012-09-17","Title":"FISHING NET ASSEMBLY AND METHOD FOR CAPTURING FISHES WITH FISHING NET","Abstract":"PURPOSE: A fishing net assembly and a method for capturing fish using a fishing net are provided to monitor fish inside a fishing net body through a camera and to lift up the fishing net body having sufficient fish inside, thereby improving the productivity of fishing operation.

Internal measuring devices measure the distortion of the handle and convert it into a weight. This is displayed on an electronic read-out which incorporates a memory. The readout is programmable for separate weights and for cumulative weights. The glass fibre handle is hollow and has the torsion measuring system inside. A laser diode with a pick-up spaced away from the diode provides one measuring method. Alternatively, a Hall effect device or a mechanical torsion monitor may be used. ADVANTAGE - Causes less stress to fish e.g. in fish rearing systems, rapid weighing process.","Applicants":"MUELLER HARTMUT;;MALLECK GUENTHER","Inventors":"MUELLER HARTMUT;;MALLECK GUENTHER","Owners":"MUELLER, HARTMUT, 7947 MENGEN, DE (1993-04-29)","URL":"https://lens.org/057-717-783-813-303","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"5","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"DISCONTINUED"},{"#":"169","Jurisdiction":"KR","Kind":"Y1","Display Key":"KR 200416442 Y1","Lens ID":"049-380-334-837-114","Publication Date":"2006-05-15","Publication Year":"2006","Application Number":"KR 20060005121 U","Application Date":"2006-02-24","Priority Numbers":"KR 20060005121 U","Earliest Priority Date":"2006-02-24","Title":"THE TRANSMISSION FOR PULL MACHINE OF FISH NET","Abstract":"","Applicants":"","Inventors":"","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/049-380-334-837-114","Document Type":"Unknown","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"3","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K73/06;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K73/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"170","Jurisdiction":"US","Kind":"A1","Display Key":"US 2021/0274760 A1","Lens ID":"061-815-716-480-389","Publication Date":"2021-09-09","Publication Year":"2021","Application Number":"US 202117331545 A","Application Date":"2021-05-26","Priority Numbers":"US 202117331545 A;;US 201816010391 A;;US 201762520930 P","Earliest Priority Date":"2017-06-16","Title":"NET COVER, CASE OR BAG, SUCH AS A FISHING NET COVER, CASE OR BAG AND A KIT INCLUDING A NET AND NET COVER, CASE, OR BAG","Abstract":"A cover for a framed net having a handle includes a first panel and a second panel.

One end of the handle is looped and provides a mouth for fish net ( 14 ). The net has two sections ( 14 A, 14 B). A first net section ( 14 A) has its mouth end attached to the net handle. The section then tapers toward its lower, also open, end which is encircled by an elastic band ( 16 ). The second net section ( 14 B) comprises a pocket whose upper, mouth end is attached to the elastic band. This lower, bottom end of the pocket is closed so fish landed in the net cannot escape from it. The pocket is elongated and of a relatively small diameter so a fish caught in the lower end of the net cannot move about too much. This allows a fisherman to readily grasp the fish by encircling his hand about the pocket and gently squeezing the fish. \n","Applicants":"SOEST ROBERT B.","Inventors":"SOEST ROBERT B","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/003-146-235-806-991","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"4","Cited by Patent Count":"7","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"43/7","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"DISCONTINUED"},{"#":"262","Jurisdiction":"CN","Kind":"A","Display Key":"CN 104430220 A","Lens ID":"009-610-708-950-518","Publication Date":"2015-03-25","Publication Year":"2015","Application Number":"CN 201410553377 A","Application Date":"2014-10-09","Priority Numbers":"CN 201410553377 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2014-10-09","Title":"Small fish net with feeding function","Abstract":"The invention discloses a small fish net with the feeding function.

landing net, or basket, is provided wherein the net is defined by top and bottom C-shaped supports secured in spaced relationship by a plurality of longitudinal ribs. Corresponding ends of the C-shaped supports are secured together by parallel, spaced slider bars which define a slot opening into the interior of the fish landing net. The slider bars are adapted to receive a snap ring which is connectable around the two bars and is slidable thereon, to close the slot and to secure a fishing line within the net. The snap ring is secured to a lowering line by means of which the net may be lowered along the fishing line to encompass a fish hooked on the fishing line. A weight is provided on the snap ring so that when the landing net surrounds the fish, the weight will carry the snap ring downwardly along the slide bars past a shoulder formed in at least one of the bars, which prevents the ring from sliding back up the slide bars. When the snap ring reaches the bottom of the slide bars, tension on the lowering rope will upend the landing net, securing the fish and allowing it to be drawn up by means of the lowering rope rather than by means of the fishing line.","Applicants":"YESURATNAM RICHARD J","Inventors":"YESURATNAM RICHARD J","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/002-148-911-954-950","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"8","Cited by Patent Count":"19","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"43/5","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"370","Jurisdiction":"GB","Kind":"A","Display Key":"GB 2322279 A","Lens ID":"009-660-678-128-499","Publication Date":"1998-08-26","Publication Year":"1998","Application Number":"GB 9723285 A","Application Date":"1997-11-05","Priority Numbers":"GB 9703923 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1997-02-25","Title":"Landing net","Abstract":"A landing net is described and comprises a hoop shaped net body member 17, which is secured to one end of a handle 13.

features a sportsman's fishing net apparatus having a shaft for thrusting the net into the moving current for the purpose of snaring a hooked fish. The net is framed upon a tubular ring-like member disposed on a distal end of the shaft. A flotation device keeps the upper part of the tubular member afloat in the water. The flotation device allows the net to maintain the same position with respect to the surface of the water, despite the induced wave motions. The shaft of the net apparatus is slidable within a collar. The collar is mountable upon trunnions attached to a bracket affixed to the side of the boat. The trunnions allow the shaft to rotate about the bracket affixed to the side of the boat, thus allowing movement with the wave motions. In one embodiment of the apparatus, the shaft is articulated in a mid-portion thereof, for the purpose of drawing the net out of the water without slidably withdrawing the net or detaching the shaft collar from its swivel mounting. A tether or cord member affixed to the tubular frame of the net is drawn towards the fisherman, causing a distal section of the shaft to bend about a mid-portion hinge. When the cord is drawn inward, the distal section automatically lifts and rotates the tubular frame towards the boat. A fish that has been captured in the net is then pulled from the water, and the fisherman can easily retrieve the netted catch.","Applicants":"WHISTLE JOY W","Inventors":"WHISTLE JOY W","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/017-671-467-562-336","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"11","Cited by Patent Count":"24","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"43/11;;43/12;;440/109","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"376","Jurisdiction":"CN","Kind":"A","Display Key":"CN 110150240 A","Lens ID":"018-219-631-123-497","Publication Date":"2019-08-23","Publication Year":"2019","Application Number":"CN 201910412311 A","Application Date":"2019-05-17","Priority Numbers":"CN 201910412311 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2019-05-17","Title":"Brail net with locked hoops capable of being folded to left and right","Abstract":"The invention relates to a brail net with locked hoops capable of being folded to left and right.

The hand-held net is operatable underwater, and specifically in saltwater. A mechanism, contained in an elongated handle, causes retraction of a predetermined section of a draw line to within the handle. The handle has pivotally attached a hoop, the hoop having attached a net. The draw line engages circumferentially the net at a location parallel to, and spaced from, the hoop. Once retraction of the draw line is activated the locations of connection of the draw line are gathered into close proximity together. This location being generally to the center of the hoop. Once retracted to this position, the net is effectively closed, preventing exit of anything contained therein through the hoop. The closed netting device is returned to an expanded position in a controlled manner by the operator by enabling a desired length of the draw line to be removed from the handle in user defined increments. This is accomplished by the incorporation of a ratchet gear in close proximity to the entry point for the draw line to the handle. The ratchet gear, having a disposed position and a engaged position, enforces a unidirectional movement of the draw line during expanding procedure. The operator would select the position of the ratchet gear during use. Opposing pulley located in the handle ensure that an adequate length of draw line is retractable, while permitting a relatively short handle to be employed.","Applicants":"BRYANT; VINCENT C.;;GREGG; LAUREN S.","Inventors":"BRYANT VINCENT C;;GREGG LAUREN S","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/040-956-850-454-250","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"10","Cited by Patent Count":"21","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"43/12;;43/11","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"407","Jurisdiction":"WO","Kind":"A1","Display Key":"WO 2012/114195 A1","Lens ID":"055-707-745-391-806","Publication Date":"2012-08-30","Publication Year":"2012","Application Number":"IB 2012000355 W","Application Date":"2012-02-27","Priority Numbers":"AU 2011/900646 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2011-02-25","Title":"HANDLE FOR RODS, POLES, LEADS OR LINES","Abstract":"A handle (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A) for a fishing rod having a main longitudinal axis (52- 52).

달려있는 낚시용 뜰채 선단부의 링 프레임과 후단부의 연결 소재 사이에 결합되는 결합소켓으로서, 연결 소재와 결합되는 결합소켓의 소정의 위치에 공기구멍이 형성되어, 그 내부의 공기 및 물을 외부로 배출시키는 결합소켓에 관한 것이다. 본 고안에 따른 공기구멍을 갖는 낚시용 뜰채의 결합소켓은, 낚시용 뜰채를 구성하는 링 프레임과 연결 소재의 사이에서 결합되며, 일단은 나선홈이 형성되어 링 프레임과 나선결합되고, 타단은 공기구멍이 형성되어 대응되는 연결 소재의 공기구멍의 위치와 맞춰진 채 접착결합됨으로써, 뜰채의 내부에 있는 공기 및 물을 배출하는 효과를 제공한다. 따라서, 연결 소재의 삽입 및 연장 동작시 내부의 공기가 공기구멍을 통해 원활히 유입, 배출되기 때문에 적은 힘만으로도 동작이 가능하다. 또한 내부로 스며든 물을 공기구멍을 통해 바로 배출할 수 있기 때문에 물이 고임으로써 내부가 부식되는 것을 방지하여 내구성을 오래 유지하는 효과가 있다.","Applicants":"신우상사주식회사","Inventors":"오재신","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/167-713-455-605-724","Document

A roller for towing a fishing rope is axially mounted to a rotating axis protruding to one side of a hydraulic motor, and the hydraulic motor is formed as a bidirectional output-type hydraulic motor by making the rotating axis of the hydraulic motor protrude to both sides. A towing roller and a discharging roller are axially mounted respectively to hydraulic motor rotating axes protruding to both sides of the bidirectional output-type hydraulic motor. A towing assisting roller is axially mounted to a front-end bottom part of the towing roller, and a direction converting roller is axially mounted to a back-end bottom part of each of the towing roller and the discharging roller respectively. A fishing rope, which is fed to a bottom part of the towing assisting roller and is towed to a top part of the towing roller, is transferred to a back bottom part of the discharging roller by converting a direction of the same in the back bottom part of the towing roller. Also, in the back bottom part of the discharging roller, the fishing rope is passed to the front of the discharging roller by converting a direction of the same by the direction converting roller, and then the fishing rope is discharged from the front to back of the discharging roller. Therefore, an output of the bidirectional output-type hydraulic motor is doubled to be utilized, and the fishing rope can be towed and discharged more efficiently.","Applicants":"PARK HONG KYU","Inventors":"PARK HONG KYU","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/168-043-886-727-180","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"1","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K91/18;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K91/18;;A01K77/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"DISCONTINUED"},{"#":"481","Jurisdiction":"KR","Kind":"Y1","Display Key":"KR 200157977 Y1","Lens ID":"169-252-506-800-225","Publication Date":"1999-10-01","Publication Year":"1999","Application Number":"KR 19970019050 U","Application Date":"1997-07-18","Priority Numbers":"KR 19970019050 U","Earliest Priority Date":"1997-07-18","Title":"THE DEVICE FOR LIFTING DRIFT GILL NET","Abstract":"개시된 내용은 개시내용은 유자망을 동력에 의해 능동적으로 걷어올려 인력의 소모정도를 감소시킬 수 있게 함으로써, 용이한 어업작업이 이루어질 수 있도록 하기 위한 것이다. 이를 실현시키기 위하여 본 고안은 어선(2)의 이물 부위에 직립하도록 고정, 설치되는 기둥부(4)와; 수직상태하에서 상기 기둥부(4)의 단부와 결합수단에 의해 연장, 결합되는 베이스플레이트(10)와; 이 베이스플레이트(10)에 구동 가능한 상태로 결합수단에 의해 결합되는 다수의 구동수단(20)과, 상기 구동수단(20)의 회전축과 함께 베이스플레이트(10)를 관통하는 상태하에서 베이스플레이트(10)에 장착되며, 구동수단(20)의 회전축들이 각각 끼워지도록 중공 형성된 다수의 외측회전축부(40)와; 이 외측회전축부(40)들의 중공으로 끼워지면서 구동수단(20)의 회전축들과 축이음부재에 의해 동력전달 가능하도록 각각 결합되는 다수의 내측회전축부(30)와; 상기 내측회전축부(30)와 결합수단에 의해 결합되는 윈치드럼(50)을 포함하여 이루어지는 유자망 거취대를 제공한다.

Landing nets. DELCEY, R. L. E. April 27, 1949 [May 20, 1948], No. 11223/49. Class 48. A landing net comprises two telescopic tubes 1, 3 urged into extended position by a spring (not shown) and a collapsible carrier for the net formed by two rods 4 slidable within the inner tube 3 and urged outwardly by a spring 32, a hand operated catch 6 on the outer tube 1 serving to release simultaneously the inner tube and the carrier from their retracted positions. The catch 6 comprises a spring-urged lever pivoted to the outside of the outer tube 1 and a spring-urged catch member 8 pivoted to the end of the lever and adapted to pass through an aperture in the outer tube to engage the edge of a slot in the inner tube 3 and a bracket 11 on the ends of the rods; the latter are hinged together by a U-shaped blade spring embracing a rubber pad riveted to the bracket 11. The end of the outer tube 3 has a head 5 formed by two triangular plates 3a, 3b, Fig. 3, which have inwardly directed rims on two of their edges held in abutment to form a housing for the ends of the rods 4 and for a bar 15 which is urged by springs 15a to engage between the rods when the latter are in splayed condition; an arm projecting from the bar through the plate 3a to terminate in a push button 16 serves to displace the bar to allow the rods to be closed. The net is attached to the rods by means of rings 18, 19 thereon. The Specification as open to inspection under Sect. 91, describes a small stirrup attached to the catch 6 to prevent accidental release of the catch and an arrangement in which the rods supporting the net are guided by two arms pivoted to the inner tube 3. It also describes a construction in which the rods are pivoted at their ends about a spindle and are urged apart by a coil spring around the spindle. This subject-matter does not appear in the Specification as accepted.","Applicants":"RAYMOND LOUIS EUGENE DELCEY","Inventors":"","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/114-185-948-854-199","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"1","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"582","Jurisdiction":"KR","Kind":"A","Display Key":"KR 950023296 A","Lens ID":"117-573-077-726-864","Publication Date":"1995-08-18","Publication Year":"1995","Application Number":"KR 19940001224 A","Application Date":"1994-01-24","Priority Numbers":"KR 19940001224 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1994-01-24","Title":"안강어망 수거장치","Abstract":"본 발명은 아암과 아암전면사이에 2개의 가압로울러를 설치하고, 아암후부의 연결편과 붐 대상단을 핀으로 연결시키며, 붐대하단은 받침대 야윽 돌출편에 핀으로 끼워지도록 하고, 붐대와 붐대사이에 고정된 지지봉에 메인실린더를 유착하여 받침대 뒷면에 고정하고, 붐대 양측지지편과 연결편 사이에는 승강실린더가 각각 설치된 것으로써, 받침대 전면 갑판상에 수거로울러가 유착된 지지대를 설치한 구성으로써, 어망 수거시 수거로울러상에 어망을 올려놓고 가압로울러로 지지시킨후 모터를 구동시켜 어망을 끌어당길 수 있도록 창안된 안강어망 수거장치에 관한 것이다.","Applicants":"양주원","Inventors":"양주원","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/117-573-077-726-864","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"1","Simple Family Size":"2","Extended Family Size":"2","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K73/06;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K73/06","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"583","Jurisdiction":"FR","Kind":"A1","Display Key":"FR 2582190 A1","Lens ID":"120-328-760-797-703","Publication Date":"1986-11-28","Publication Year":"1986","Application Number":"FR 8507833 A","Application Date":"1985-05-22","Priority Numbers":"FR 8507833 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1985-05-22","Title":"Fish gauge","Abstract":"Invention allowing fish to be measured with the aid of a gauge, whatever the orientation of the fish in the gauge without the fisherman having to touch the fish either to measure it or to remove the hook.

Additionally, a handle or a string can be selectively combined in the first filter part, thereby being able to be used in many ways depending on the place and collecting methods. And an exclusive collection bottle can be combined with the catcher if combining a bottle cap with a cock in the second filter part so that the convenience in handling is increased enough to control with one hand and the applicability is improved by allowing a funnel or a lid to be combined with the cock. Lastly, the plankton catcher can be made of metal or plastic selectively so that the weight and manufacturing costs are adjustable, thereby being able to be produced and used as a tool for education as well as research.","Applicants":"KIM JI HEE","Inventors":"KIM JI HEE","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/196-316-245-799-64X","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"4","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K75/00;;A01K77/00;;G01N33/48","IPCR Classifications":"A01K74/00;;A01K75/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"DISCONTINUED"},{"#":"618","Jurisdiction":"US","Kind":"A","Display Key":"US 752550 A","Lens ID":"189-545-733-663-35X","Publication Date":"1904-02-16","Publication Year":"1904","Application Number":"US 752550D A","Application Date":"","Priority Numbers":"","Earliest Priority Date":"","Title":"US 752550 A","Abstract":"","Applicants":"","Inventors":"","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/189-545-733-663-35X","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"12","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"619","Jurisdiction":"CN","Kind":"A","Display Key":"CN 111513038 A","Lens ID":"185-558-838-762-79X","Publication Date":"2020-08-11","Publication Year":"2020","Application Number":"CN 202010467636 A","Application Date":"2020-05-28","Priority Numbers":"CN 202010467636 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2020-05-28","Title":"Acetes chinensis sampling diddle-net","Abstract":"The invention discloses an acetes chinensis sampling diddle-net.

As there are no holes drilled through the frame, the frame is not weakened by a loss of material, and no water enters into the frame. Thus, the life of the net is prolonged relative to conventional nets. The frame and handle are preferably formed of a carbon fiber material. In addition to facilitating the formation of the flange and holes therein, forming the frame of carbon fiber allows the net to be custom shaped as desired. Additionally, in comparison to convention wooden nets, a carbon fiber net is significantly lighter. \n","Applicants":"BLAKE TODD","Inventors":"BLAKE TODD","Owners":"AQUAFLY INC (2001-07-16)","URL":"https://lens.org/031-023-819-153-854","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"8","Cited by Patent Count":"1","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"43/11","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"DISCONTINUED"},{"#":"640","Jurisdiction":"WO","Kind":"A1","Display Key":"WO 1984/000667 A1","Lens ID":"050-311-566-291-436","Publication Date":"1984-03-01","Publication Year":"1984","Application Number":"AU 1912/083001 W","Application Date":"1983-08-23","Priority Numbers":"AU 551182 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1982-08-23","Title":"FISHING GAFF","Abstract":"A fishing gaff (10) (30) or landing net (20) having a light source (24, 34) mounted within the shaft of the gaff adjacent the hook (12, 32) or net (22) section of the gaff so that emitted light illuminates the hook (12) (32) or net (22) section.","Applicants":"ARTHUR EDWARD PTY LTD;;SUNLEA DEV PTY LTD","Inventors":"LARKING BRYAN JAMES","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/050-311-566-291-436","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"3","Cited by Patent Count":"2","Simple Family Size":"2","Extended Family Size":"4","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K97/14;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K97/14","US Classifications":"A1A A39           A39","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"PENDING"},{"#":"641","Jurisdiction":"US","Kind":"A","Display Key":"US 4706404 A","Lens ID":"059-921-909-333-016","Publication Date":"1987-11-17","Publication Year":"1987","Application Number":"US 88559886 A","Application Date":"1986-07-14","Priority Numbers":"US 88559886 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1986-07-14","Title":"Opening and recovering type net device","Abstract":"A kind of opening and recovering type net device, in which the net frame includes several joints and frame rods together with the function of driving shaft and transmission assemblies to form into a retractable mechanism that can be put into an adjustable sleeve assembly.

The apparatus includes an elongate handle coupled distally with a hoop and a flexible net mounted about the circumference of the hoop opening to form a net bunt. Access into and out of the net bunt is selectively restricted by a unique net closure mechanism associated with the handle, hoop and net. The net closure mechanism includes a pair of elastic bands disposed across the hoop opening with the net disposed between the bands to create the net mouth. A drawing apparatus is adapted to stretch the bands apart from one another from their normally relaxed substantially parallel orientation wherein the net mouth is said to be “closed” to its “open” position wherein the bands are held under tension. Releasing tension on the bands is carried out by activating a trigger on the handle causing the bands to rapidly return to their closed position for capture of prey within the net bunt.","Applicants":"PATTERSON KENNETH W","Inventors":"PATTERSON KENNETH W","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/090-693-158-937-776","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"8","Cited by Patent Count":"4","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K74/00;;A01K77/00;;A01K77/00;;A01K74/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K74/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"ACTIVE"},{"#":"672","Jurisdiction":"US","Kind":"A","Display Key":"US 520567 A","Lens ID":"095-701-110-476-447","Publication Date":"1894-05-29","Publication Year":"1894","Application Number":"US 520567D A","Application Date":"","Priority Numbers":"","Earliest Priority Date":"","Title":"US 520567 A","Abstract":"","Applicants":"","Inventors":"","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/095-701-110-476-447","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"4","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"673","Jurisdiction":"CN","Kind":"A","Display Key":"CN 112586462 A","Lens ID":"084-782-045-379-920","Publication Date":"2021-04-02","Publication Year":"2021","Application Number":"CN 202011425240 A","Application Date":"2020-12-08","Priority Numbers":"CN 202011425240 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2020-12-08","Title":"Fishing net special for live fish harvesting","Abstract":"The invention belongs to the technical field of fishery tools, and particularly relates to a fishing net special for live fish harvesting.

Anglers' landing nets. R. SPENCER. Oct.19, 1960 [Oct. 19, 1959], No. 35296/59. Heading A1A. A landing net comprises a pair of hollow net supporting arms 14 pivoted to a carrier 12 slidable on a handle 10 from a stowed position near a hand grip 11 to an in-use position at the other end, and means for opening the arms when the carrier is in the in-use position. The means for opening the arms comprises a slidable spindle 22 which extends from a boss 23 mounted on the hand grip end of the handle; the spindle is turned back at its forward end and enters a bore in the forward end of the handle. The bore contains a spring which urges the spindle forwardly. The rear end of the spindle has a catch 24 which co-operates with slots 23b in the boss 23 to hold the spindle retracted. The arms 14 are actuated by a toggle system consisting of two pairs of bars 16, 17 pivoted to a slide bar 19 slidable on the spindle 22 and having a spring mounted rib 32 engaging a shoulder on a stop 29 on the forward end of the spindle 22. The carrier is held in forward position by a blade spring and stud 30a engaging a head 30 on the front end of the handle 10. In operation the carrier is slid manually to the forward end of the handle and the spindle 22 is drawn back to move the slide bar 19 and the toggle linkage to pivot the arms outwardly. The catch 24 is then engaged. Releasing the catch allows the spindle to be moved forwardly by its spring and, as the rib 32 is engaged with the shoulder of the stop 29, the slide bar 19 also moves forwardly to close the arms. To return the net to the stowed position the arms are first set in the open position and the carrier then slid back. The stud 30a first disengages from the head 30 to allow the carrier to move relatively to the slide bar 19 to close the arms. The rib 32 then disengages from the shoulder on the stop 29 so that the carrier and slide bar can be slid along the handle. The slide bar 19 is assisted in sliding rearwardly relative to the carrier by a spring T located between a lug 25 on the carrier and a sleeve 26 which slides on the spindle 22 and abuts on end 21 of the slide bar. A blade spring 27 secured to the carrier has a rib 27a which is forced into engagement with the end of the sleeve 26 by a bolt 19a. When the slide bar is moved rearwardly the rib 27a disengages but when the carrier is moved rearwardly the rib 27a remains engaged. The carrier has a U-clip 28 for engaging the angler's belt; The opening of the clip can be varied by a screw and spring 28a; the clip may swivel. A bead coated with luminous material and a wire guard may be mounted at the end of each net arm. The front of the net is supported by a cord which passes into the hollow arms and is resiliently mounted therein.","Applicants":"ROBERT SPENCER","Inventors":"","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/165-472-345-269-961","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"3","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"808","Jurisdiction":"US","Kind":"A1","Display Key":"US 2005/0055864 A1","Lens ID":"158-798-619-754-654","Publication Date":"2005-03-17","Publication Year":"2005","Application Number":"US 66207103 A","Application Date":"2003-09-15","Priority Numbers":"US 66207103 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2003-09-15","Title":"Foot operated fishing net tipper","Abstract":"The present invention relates to a foot operated fishing net tipping apparatus releasably attached to a fishing boat comprising: a boat-attaching portion, a net-holding portion, a lock portion, a foot pedal portion and connecting members.

To use the weight scale the fish is retained in the net basket and the distal end of the handle is held up to allow the major portion of the handle and the fishing net basket to extend under gravity below the point of hanging support. In this manner, the weight of the fish within the fishing net basket is shown on an indicator positioned in the end (movable) component of the handle that shows through an aligned aperture on the main (fixed) handle component. The movable end component of the handle moves telescopically with respect to the fixed handle component. The weight measuring assembly preferably incorporates an internally fixed spring extending between the movable component and the fixed component of the handle. Alternately, a solid state electronic scale could be incorporated into the handle in the same position. A length measuring device in the form of imprinted or engraved markings along the length of the handle may optionally be incorporated so as to provide a readily available means for measuring the length of the fish. The length scale would preferably extend from the point of attachment between the handle of the fishing net and the circular basket section such that the fish might be retained within the net basket and flipped over to extend along the handle for measurement.","Applicants":"BOND JARED;;BOND KIRK","Inventors":"BOND JARED;;BOND KIRK","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/198-002-124-618-698","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"28","Cited by Patent Count":"12","Simple Family Size":"2","Extended Family Size":"2","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;A01K77/00;;G01G19/60;;G01G19/60","IPCR Classifications":"G01G19/60;;A01K75/00","US Classifications":"177/245;;43/7","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"INACTIVE"},{"#":"833","Jurisdiction":"KR","Kind":"A","Display Key":"KR 20050120560 A","Lens ID":"194-284-009-852-932","Publication Date":"2005-12-22","Publication Year":"2005","Application Number":"KR 20040081746 A","Application Date":"2004-10-13","Priority Numbers":"JP 2004179868 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2004-06-17","Title":"ROLLER DEVICE TO ASSIST IN NET HAULING AND NET HAULING METHOD USING THE SAME","Abstract":"","Applicants":"MARINE HYDROTEC CO LTD","Inventors":"OISHI HIDEHARU;;YAMAMOTO KENICHIRO","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/194-284-009-852-932","Document Type":"Patent Application","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"0","Cited by Patent Count":"2","Simple Family Size":"6","Extended Family Size":"8","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K73/053;;A01K73/06;;A01K77/00;;Y02P60/60","IPCR Classifications":"A01K73/06;;A01K77/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"ACTIVE"},{"#":"834","Jurisdiction":"US","Kind":"A","Display Key":"US 2504356 A","Lens ID":"193-511-334-669-673","Publication Date":"1950-04-18","Publication Year":"1950","Application Number":"US 60632345 A","Application Date":"1945-07-21","Priority Numbers":"US 60632345 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1945-07-21","Title":"Snap hook structure","Abstract":"","Applicants":"MARTIN C KLANN","Inventors":"STALKER HERBERT J","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/193-511-334-669-673","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"1","Cited by Patent Count":"5","Simple Family Size":"1","Extended Family Size":"1","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"Y10T24/45403;;A01K77/00;;A01K77/00;;F16B45/049","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"835","Jurisdiction":"FR","Kind":"A1","Display Key":"FR 2338773 A1","Lens ID":"193-906-180-299-88X","Publication Date":"1977-08-19","Publication Year":"1977","Application Number":"FR 7602068 A","Application Date":"1976-01-21","Priority Numbers":"FR 7602068 A","Earliest Priority Date":"1976-01-21","Title":"Collapsible fishermans keep net with rod handle - has recoil mechanisms for extension and three way hinge joining rod to net support arms","Abstract":"The fishermans keep net with a telescopically retractable rod handle includes a three-way hinge at the junction of the rod and the two branches supporting the net.

A tubular landing net frame and handle incorporates at least three rod-shaped hinges. The hinge for the landing net comprises a cylindrical base element with locking shoulders on each end with pin rotatable, cylindrical and hooked extension elements. The extension elements have slots to accommodate the pins on the base element. Each extension element has a spring-loaded locking button for interacting with first locking apertures in the tubular net frame and handle. Each hook on the extension element is connected to a spring, anchored within the tubular frame. The folding procedure only requires a pull on the landing net frame at the joints to dislodge the locking buttons to expand the anchor springs and engage the locking buttons in second (limited in diameter) apertures of the tubular frame, thus to hold the net and handle in the folded position. The unfolding procedure requires minimum effort in dislodging the buttons to permit the expanded anchored springs to urge the opening of the landing net and handle. The snow stick incorporates at least two solid rod-shaped hinges. The folded snow stick can be conveniently carried in a case strapped to one's waist and thigh.","Applicants":"BAKER; MONTY R.","Inventors":"BAKER MONTY R","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/106-338-028-418-372","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"yes","Cites Patent Count":"17","Cited by Patent Count":"21","Simple Family Size":"3","Extended Family Size":"4","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"A01K77/00;;E05D11/1007;;F16C11/04;;Y10T403/32918;;Y10T403/32918;;A01K77/00;;E05D11/1007;;F16C11/04","IPCR Classifications":"A01K77/00;;E05D11/10;;F16C11/04","US Classifications":"43/12;;403/157;;16/366","NPL Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"","Legal Status":"EXPIRED"},{"#":"910","Jurisdiction":"CN","Kind":"C","Display Key":"CN 100357169 C","Lens ID":"127-402-260-406-881","Publication Date":"2007-12-26","Publication Year":"2007","Application Number":"CN 200510006297 A","Application Date":"2005-02-02","Priority Numbers":"EP 04405064 A","Earliest Priority Date":"2004-02-02","Title":"Method for the design of a regulator for vibration damping at an elevator car","Abstract":"","Applicants":"INVENTIO AG","Inventors":"JOSEF HUSMANN;;HANS MUSCH","Owners":"","URL":"https://lens.org/127-402-260-406-881","Document Type":"Granted Patent","Has Full Text":"no","Cites Patent Count":"10","Cited by Patent Count":"1","Simple Family Size":"20","Extended Family Size":"22","Sequence Count":"0","CPC Classifications":"B66B7/041;;B66B7/046;;A01K77/00;;B66B7/046;;B66B7/041","IPCR Classifications":"B66B7/04;;B66B1/00;;B66B1/44","US Classifications":"","NPL Citation Count":"1","NPL Resolved Citation Count":"0","NPL Resolved Lens ID(s)":"","NPL Resolved External ID(s)":"","NPL Citations":"Vibration Control for Machining Using H ∞ Techniques.

In the improvement, the outer ends extend along an axis and the mechanism is mounted for pivoting movement about the axis. The mechanism pivots between a first position preventing folding the frame members and a second position permitting folding such members.
