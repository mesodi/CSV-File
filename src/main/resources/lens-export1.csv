When a fish is caught, the fist net, using only one hand is unfolded quickly when the fish is ready to be netted. During its quick one handed rotating to unfurl the netting and continued quick one handed sequential unfolding around two orthogonal axes, pivotal joints of the folding fish net at four locations are utilized. After the unfurling of the netting, during the first unfolding from the compacted non use position, a then longitudinally positioned divided handle, pivotally connected by a then horizontally arranged piano style hinge, and a central rim pivot joint on the folded rim, presently located closely opposite the handle, are both pivoted downwardly at the same time, through 180.degree. around a first then horizontally positioned rotational axis. Thereafter, two rim pivot joints on opposite sides of the foldable rim are pivoted about a horizontal rotational axis perpendicular to the first rotational axis, to enable the rim to be unfolded from its half size up and over through 180.degree. to full circle size, thereby supporting a full circular draping net which is passed under a fish. The divided handle, when fully open, via its piano style hinge, backs against itself to prevent further rotational movement. When a fisherman continues to grip the open handle, refolding of the net is prevented, without relying on any locking means. During this rapid one handed deployment of the folded fish net into a fully opened net, biasing springs are relied upon to snap the rim into its circular configuration. Also extruded stops prevent further rotational movement of the components of the rim once they reach the then horizontal circular configuration as they are unfolded to support the netting for receiving a fish. The fisherman, using his other hand to guide the fishing pole is still successfully managing the hooked fish as the fish is netted.",DAVIS BENNIE I,DAVIS BENNIE I,"DAVIS, EDNA E. 6149 BELMORE ROAD SW OLYMPIA, WASHI (1970-08-21)",https://lens.org/118-711-001-994-036,Granted Patent,yes,16,18,1,1,0,A01K77/00;;A01K77/00,A01K77/00,43/12,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A first net section ( 14 A) has its mouth end attached to the net handle. The section then tapers toward its lower, also open, end which is encircled by an elastic band ( 16 ). The second net section ( 14 B) comprises a pocket whose upper, mouth end is attached to the elastic band. This lower, bottom end of the pocket is closed so fish landed in the net cannot escape from it. The pocket is elongated and of a relatively small diameter so a fish caught in the lower end of the net cannot move about too much. This allows a fisherman to readily grasp the fish by encircling his hand about the pocket and gently squeezing the fish.

   A multipurpose fishing net for sport anglers serves as a landing net, a strip box for holding line stripped from a reel prior to casting, and also as a shallow container for temporarily holding a freshly caught fish for photography or other momentary capture before release. A rigid frame is formed of lightweight tubular components, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. The structure is buoyant, with additional flotation provided by closed cell foam. A net is secured to two opposite sides or more preferably to all four sides of the frame, around the floatation foam portions. The net has some slack therein so that it extends loosely between opposite sides, to allow a captured fish to reside mostly within the water when the present net is floating therein. A tether extends from the frame of the device, for temporary attachment to clothing or other article.

The hand-held net is operatable underwater, and specifically in saltwater. A mechanism, contained in an elongated handle, causes retraction of a predetermined section of a draw line to within the handle. The handle has pivotally attached a hoop, the hoop having attached a net. The draw line engages circumferentially the net at a location parallel to, and spaced from, the hoop. Once retraction of the draw line is activated the locations of connection of the draw line are gathered into close proximity together. This location being generally to the center of the hoop. Once retracted to this position, the net is effectively closed, preventing exit of anything contained therein through the hoop. The closed netting device is returned to an expanded position in a controlled manner by the operator by enabling a desired length of the draw line to be removed from the handle in user defined increments. This is accomplished by the incorporation of a ratchet gear in close proximity to the entry point for the draw line to the handle. The ratchet gear, having a disposed position and a engaged position, enforces a unidirectional movement of the draw line during expanding procedure. The operator would select the position of the ratchet gear during use.

Since a circular net in the first filter part and a fabric net in the second filter part can be replaced with nets whose meshes vary in size, one plankton catcher can perform a role as a number of plankton catchers. Additionally, a handle or a string can be selectively combined in the first filter part, thereby being able to be used in many ways depending on the place and collecting methods. And an exclusive collection bottle can be combined with the catcher if combining a bottle cap with a cock in the second filter part so that the convenience in handling is increased enough to control with one hand and the applicability is improved by allowing a funnel or a lid to be combined with the cock.

   A fly fishing net is disclosed including an integrally formed handle and frame. The frame includes an interior flange in which holes are formed for receiving a mesh netting. As there are no holes drilled through the frame, the frame is not weakened by a loss of material, and no water enters into the frame. Thus, the life of the net is prolonged relative to conventional nets. The frame and handle are preferably formed of a carbon fiber material. In addition to facilitating the formation of the flange and holes therein, forming the frame of carbon fiber allows the net to be custom shaped as desired. Additionally, in comparison to convention wooden nets, a carbon fiber net is significantly lighter.

Oct.19, 1960 [Oct. 19, 1959], No. 35296/59. Heading A1A. A landing net comprises a pair of hollow net supporting arms 14 pivoted to a carrier 12 slidable on a handle 10 from a stowed position near a hand grip 11 to an in-use position at the other end, and means for opening the arms when the carrier is in the in-use position. The means for opening the arms comprises a slidable spindle 22 which extends from a boss 23 mounted on the hand grip end of the handle; the spindle is turned back at its forward end and enters a bore in the forward end of the handle. The bore contains a spring which urges the spindle forwardly. The rear end of the spindle has a catch 24 which co-operates with slots 23b in the boss 23 to hold the spindle retracted. The arms 14 are actuated by a toggle system consisting of two pairs of bars 16, 17 pivoted to a slide bar 19 slidable on the spindle 22 and having a spring mounted rib 32 engaging a shoulder on a stop 29 on the forward end of the spindle 22. The carrier is held in forward position by a blade spring and stud 30a engaging a head 30 on the front end of the handle 10. In operation the carrier is slid manually to the forward end of the handle and the spindle 22 is drawn back to move the slide bar 19 and the toggle linkage to pivot the arms outwardly. The catch 24 is then engaged. Releasing the catch allows the spindle to be moved forwardly by its spring and, as the rib 32 is engaged with the shoulder of the stop 29, the slide bar 19 also moves forwardly to close the arms. To return the net to the stowed position the arms are first set in the open position and the carrier then slid back. The stud 30a first disengages from the head 30 to allow the carrier to move relatively to the slide bar 19 to close the arms. The rib 32 then disengages from the shoulder on the stop 29 so that the carrier and slide bar can be slid along the handle. The slide bar 19 is assisted in sliding rearwardly relative to the carrier by a spring T located between a lug 25 on the carrier and a sleeve 26 which slides on the spindle 22 and abuts on end 21 of the slide bar. A blade spring 27 secured to the carrier has a rib 27a which is forced into engagement with the end of the sleeve 26 by a bolt 19a. When the slide bar is moved rearwardly the rib 27a disengages but when the carrier is moved rearwardly the rib 27a remains engaged. The carrier has a U-clip 28 for engaging the angler's belt; The opening of the clip can be varied by a screw and spring 28a; the clip may swivel. A bead coated with luminous material and a wire guard may be mounted at the end of each net arm. The front of the net is supported by a cord which passes into the hollow arms and is resiliently mounted therein.",ROBERT SPENCER,,,https://lens.org/165-472-345-269-961,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,A01K77/00,A01K77/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
